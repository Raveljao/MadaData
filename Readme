Madagascar Population Visualization (2020)
This project aims to visualize population data from Madagascar in 3D using a publicly available dataset. The visualization is created using R, leveraging various libraries for data processing, spatial analysis, and rendering.

Project Overview
This script reads population data from a CSV file, processes it into a spatial object, and then converts it into a raster format. The raster data is then used to generate a 3D model, which is rendered with custom colors and lighting to create a high-quality image.

Prerequisites
To run this code, you need to have the following R packages installed:

readr: For reading CSV files.
sp: For handling spatial data.
raster: For creating raster data from spatial data.
MetBrewer: For generating color palettes.
rayshader: For rendering 3D visualizations.
glue: For string manipulation.
crayon: For colored terminal output.
png: For handling PNG files.
